## Description

We designed CryptoKnight to be a useful dashboard for cryptocurrency investors to keep an eye on their wallet and track their successes over time.  Here's how we've designed CryptoKnight to be used:
* You can search for your favorite cryptocurrencies to find their current price.
* You can select the number of coins purchased for each cryptocurrency and input the price you paid when you bought them.
* Once added to your Wallet, CryptoKnight will show you your total profit or loss on your investments for each cryptocurrency, as well as your total Wallet value and profit/loss.
